# Online learning platform
 A 3-tier architecture website using Django as a database, python for constructing API routes, and JavaScript for dynamic user interface. Itâ€™s about online courses featuring two separate interfaces: one for professors and one for students. For students, they can enroll in courses, ask queries regarding specific posted lectures, and receive responses from the professors. As for professors, they can create new courses, upload lectures, and receive queries from the batch of students.
